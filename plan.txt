Debrief for when I wake up:
* test individual centerline diameter compute
* Specifically datmean and dirVector getting for slices
it seems like normal diameter chunking works
but I don't fully trust it yet. Look through the 
loops for bugs

This research will aid in the visualization
of small structures and aid in the 
development of microchannel cooling.

Can changing the parameters of the CT-Scan processing
of a DMLS produced microchannel change how accurate the regenerated model is and to
what extent does it improve the model?

As electronics
become increasingly powerful and miniaturized, heat dissipation
becomes a more important problem to address. This has resulted in the need for
cooling methods to become smaller and thereby more complex to manufacture.
DMLS offers the flexibility to achieve such designs due to its additive manufacturing nature,
which can build shapes that are harder for other manufacturing methods to achieve.
However, DMLS builds result in some rough surfaces, depending on build orientation.
Many studies have explored the quality of DMLS prints and accurate visualization methodologies are important for
evaluating the results of such work. While there have been studies exploring various factors that
can affect the precision of scans based on things like material and thickness, my research
will attempt to find the optimal parameters for processing the scans in order to
provide the most accurate separation of materials. Such improvements could be generalized
towards any work involving the need of high precision computed imagery.

In my research, I aim to find the optimal parameters for processing scans to provide
the most accurate separation of materials. Direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) is a 
manufacturing process that can build shapes that are harder for other manufacturing methods 
to achieve, making it useful for complex cooling systems for electronics. However, DMLS builds 
can result in rough surfaces, and precise visualization is important in evaluating the results 
of DMLS prints. While there have been studies exploring various factors that can affect the precision 
of scans, my work will focus on finding the optimal parameters for scan processing. Such 
improvements could be generalized to any work involving high precision computed imagery.

In my research, I will find the optimal thresholding parameters for processing scans to find the most
accurate separation of materials. Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) is a manufacturing 
process that is more flexible than other manufacturing methods. It can build shapes that
are harder for other methods to produce, which makes it useful for complex microchannels for 
electronics cooling systems. However, DMLS builds can result in rough surfaces depending on 
factors like build orientation, and accurate visualization is important for evaluating the 
results of DMLS prints. While studies have explored the factors affecting the precision of 
the scans, my research will attempt to find the optimal parameters for post scan processing 
of the images. These improvements could be generalized to any work involving high precision 
computed imagery.
